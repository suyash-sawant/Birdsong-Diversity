# Birdsong-Diversity
This repository contains R codes to compute the song diversity using Song Richness Index (SRI) as defined in Sawant, S., Arvind, C., Joshi, V., Robin, V. V. (2021)- Song Richness Index: A measure to understand the diversity and repetition of notes in a birdsong

SRI.R This R-program calculates the Song Richness Index SRI using give note sequences Input files: 1. Data frame with space seprated note sequences

SRI_Raven.R This R-program calculates the Song Richness Index SRI using the Note types provided in Raven Pro selection tables Input files: 1. Raven selection table with Note types and Song No. columns

All note combinations.txt This is a sample data set for SRI.R that contains note sequences of songs till 10 notes

WBS-sample.txt This is a sample data set (Raven selection table) for SRI_Raven.R that contains notes of real birdsongs of White-bellied Sholakili Sholicola albiventris
